# legal-e-portal
This was a SIH Problem Statement given by Ministry of Law and Justice .
This Web application specifically helps in legal case management with case tracking and case history abilities. Entire System works on Role based access Model,
Which means that Judge , Lawyer and Court-staff will have their own Dashboard with them and no one can access each other's dashboards.
The Court-Staff is the main Authority in this web application which has the ability to Create Cases , modify case details , assign lawyer and judges to each case,
mark cases as closed or on-going , additionally it displays the all the cases on-going in the system with all neccessary details with it , also displays
all the available judges and lawyers in it database System.
